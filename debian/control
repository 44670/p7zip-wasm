Description: 7zr file archiver with high compression ratio
 p7zip is the Unix port of 7-Zip, a file archiver that archives with
 very high compression ratios.
 .
 p7zip provides:
  - /usr/bin/7zr
    a standalone minimal version of the 7-zip tool that only handles
    7z archives. 7z compression is 30-50% better than ZIP compression.
  - /usr/bin/p7zip
    a gzip like wrapper around 7zr.
 .
 p7zip-full provides 7z and 7za which support more compression formats.

Description: 7z and 7za file archivers with high compression ratio
 p7zip is the Unix port of 7-Zip, a file archiver that archives with
 very high compression ratios.
 .
 p7zip-full provides:
  - /usr/bin/7za
     a standalone version of the 7-zip tool that handles 7z archives
     (implementation of the LZMA compression algorithm) and some other
     formats.
  - /usr/bin/7z
     not only does it handle 7z but also ZIP, Zip64, CAB, RAR, ARJ,
     GZIP, BZIP2, TAR, CPIO, RPM, ISO and DEB archives. 7z compression
     is 30-50% better than ZIP compression.

<P>Large Pages mode increases the speed of compression.
However, there is a pause at the start of compression while 7-Zip allocates the large pages in memory.
If 7-Zip can't allocate large pages, it allocates usual small pages.
Also, the Windows Task Manager doesn't show the real memory usage of the program, if 7-Zip uses large pages.
This feature works only on Windows 2003 / XP x64. 
Also, it requires administrator's rights for your system.
The recommended size of RAM for this feature is 1 GB or more.
To install this feature, you must run the 7-Zip File Manager at least once, 
close it, and then reboot the system.</P>
<P>Your system can hang for several seconds at compressing starting, if you use -slp mode.
So it's not recommended to use -slp mode to compress small data sets (less than 100 MB).</P>

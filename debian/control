Description: 7-Zip is a file archiver with high compression ratio
 7-Zip is the file archiver that archives with the highest compression
 ratios. The program supports 7z (that implements LZMA compression
 algorithm), ZIP, Zip64, CAB, RAR, ARJ, GZIP, BZIP2, TAR, CPIO, RPM and
 DEB formats. Compression ratios with the new 7z format are 30 to 50%
 better than ratios with the ZIP format.
 .
 Currently, p7zip (like 7-zip) supports both little and big endian
 machines.

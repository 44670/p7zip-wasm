The upstream tarball is repacked in order to remove non-free rar
code (and a few pre-compiled binary files lintian complains about).

List of removed files can be found in the `Files-Excluded' header
of debian/copyright.

The uscan(1) command can be used to download and repack new versions
of upstream tarballs.

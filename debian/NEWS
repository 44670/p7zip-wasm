p7zip (15.09+dfsg-3) experimental; urgency=low

  The p7zip-full package now depends on p7zip package in order
  to have the p7zip wrapper script available for all users of
  the packages.

  The p7zip wrapper script was enhanced to support more options.

  HTML documentation is now installed by the p7zip-full package only.

p7zip (4.37.dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - introduces 7zr, a light version of 7za
  * debian/control:
    - now p7zip only provides 7zr (Closes: #343513)
    - p7zip recommends p7zip-full, much more similar to the old p7zip

  * debian/patches:
    - 01_add_help_switch.dpatch: applies on new upstream version
    - 01_main_help.dpatch: removed from diff.gz; correct the result of "7z -h"

    - 02_man.dpatch: removed from diff.gz; adds 7zr.1 and other corrections

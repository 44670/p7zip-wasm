                 (ex:  ln -s .. ldir)

  - makefile.linux_gcc_2.95_no_need_for_libstdc added to build 7za for the
    p7zip*_bin.tar.bz2 package.

    (on some MacOSX, CC is a link to gcc instead of g++)

  - new flag "-utf16" to enable "utf16" conversion [Bug #1075229].

  - new logic to automatically enable or disable "utf16" conversion :
    no locale, locale=="C" or locale=="POSIX" implies utf16=off
    else  utf16=on
    uses "-utf16" or "-no-utf16" to change this behaviour.
    [Bug #1075229]

    do not stop archiving but displays a warning).

============
  - new port of 7za from the source of 7za 4.10Beta for Windows
    => p7zip now work on big endian CPU.

  - 7z for Unix is not maintain anymore (because as the source of unrar plugin for 7z

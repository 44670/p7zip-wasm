Description: 7z file archiver with high compression ratio
 p7zip is the Unix command-line port of 7-Zip, a file archiver that
 archives with high compression ratios.
 .
 p7zip provides:
  - /usr/bin/7zr
    a standalone minimal version of the 7-zip tool that only handles
    7z archives. 7z compression is 30-50% better than ZIP compression.
  - /usr/bin/p7zip
    a gzip-like wrapper around 7zr.
 .
 p7zip can be used with popular compression interfaces (such as File
 Roller or Nautilus).
 .
 p7zip-full provides 7z and 7za which support more compression formats.

Description: 7z and 7za file archivers with high compression ratio
 p7zip is the Unix command-line port of 7-Zip, a file archiver that
 archives with high compression ratios.
 .
 p7zip-full provides utilities to pack and unpack 7z archives within
 a shell or using a GUI (such as Ark, File Roller or Nautilus).
 .
 Installing p7zip-full allows File Roller to use the very efficient 7z
 compression format for packing and unpacking files and directories.
 Additionally, it provides the 7z and 7za commands.
 .
